# simulated-galaxy-props

(forked from Paulinappl/SFRs-calculator).

Updated version of a galaxy property inference model originally designed to measure star-formation rates (SFRs) for galaxies based on optical to mid-infrared data. We use a random forest model trained on simulated galaxy features from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite.
